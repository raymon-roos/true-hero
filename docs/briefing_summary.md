### Briefing summary - Monday, 29th of January 2024 - Hero Association

Today, a briefing was held to introduce the Hero Association's project for developing
a new Hero Ranking Platform. As software engineer contractors, we had to learn about the
organization's modus operandi. The Organization plays a pivotal role in society in
managing Heroes. Until now, this involved a lot of paper work and manual intervention. Our
goal is to change this.

Our platform will combine a smooth on-boarding experience for collecting all of a Hero's
information with a global leader board and duel managing system. This will reduce labour
cost, improve data accuracy, and aid in future development velocity, as well as give
Heroes unparalleled insight into their own public profile.
