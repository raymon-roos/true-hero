# Individual Brainstorm

This document presents my brainstorming ideas for the One Punch Man project, which we are developing during this deep dive week.

## Tech Stack

For robust security and privacy in the project, leveraging pre-built packages is a practical approach, especially given the one-week timeframe. This strategy allows for a secure, out-of-the-box authentication system. Additionally, using a dashboard framework for the admin panel is advisable. Based on these considerations, my suggested tech stack includes:

1. Laravel as the full-stack framework.
2. Jetstream for login and registration.
3. Laravel Filament for the admin panel dashboard.
4. Blade templates, integrated with Tailwind CSS.

## Team Collaboration

Effective communication is crucial for team coordination and future collaborations. My recommendations are:

1. Use of Conventional Commits for consistent commit messages.
2. Implementing a Scrum board on BitLab, linked with the repository for automatic update displays.
3. Daily stand-ups and retrospectives to maintain team progress updates.
