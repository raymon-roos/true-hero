# One-Punch Man Project Brainstorm

The project has clear boundaries, so this brainstorm focusses on implementation and
technical solutions.

## On-boarding

Because user experience is critical in this part, it might be a good idea to have a separate
site/application with better front-end capabilities to handle just the on-boarding.

### Pros

-   Separate framework/library for on boarding flow with nicer front-end

### Cons

-   Less cohesion

## Dashboard

Use Laravel and PHPFilament to scaffold resource controllers, forms, and a dashboard with
widgets.

### Pros

-   Fast development, lots of features

### Cons

-   Very recognizable branding, hard to customize


## Database

Use a graph database for a social-media platform like performance and scale

### Pros

- Handles very large amounts of inter-related data

### Cons

- No experience with graph databases
